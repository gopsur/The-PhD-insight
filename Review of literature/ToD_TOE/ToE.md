			This paper explains the expected changes in the climate of the tropical Pacific due to climate change, and how determining the time of emergence of these climate change signals is important for mitigation strategies and adaptation planning. It states that the annual-mean sea surface temperature signal has already emerged across much of the tropical Pacific, but the ENSO-related rainfall variability signal is projected to emerge by about 2040, and the ENSO-related SST variability signal at about 2070.
