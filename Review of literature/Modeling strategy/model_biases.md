Several common climatological biases have been found in the models involved in the third and fifth phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5, respectively), such as the double inter- tropical convergence zone problem (Lin 2007; Hwang and Frierson 2013; Li and Xie 2014), a warm SST bias in the southeastern Pacific (Zheng et al. 2011), and an excessive cold tongue SST bias in the equatorial Pacific (Li and Xie 2012; Zheng et al. 2012). These biases reflect some common deficiencies of the models, which may interact with the warming effect from GHG forcing, and produce unrealistic climate changes that interfere with model projections (Whet-ton et al. 2007; Collins et al. 2010, 2012).
