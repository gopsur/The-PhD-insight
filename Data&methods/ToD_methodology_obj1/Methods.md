      > removed 1890-1950 monthly climatology (our reference period; we test departures from that period)
      > Secondary ref period: For ref period check, 1920-1970 Here all the analysis styarts from 1920 onwards

      > zero- padding at the beginning of time series for 60 years (i.e. during 1831-1890 [1861-1920] ) to ensure near-zero trend during the reference period 1890-1950 [1920-1970]
