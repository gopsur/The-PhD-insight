Why i am doing this?

1. To compare how zhang doone this computation, and how much it is matching with observations, for using in our modelling strategy
2. It is not practically possible to run a lot of number of models to get a MMM (which remove much of internal variability among models) , so we can make use of the wide range of CMIP models to understand how each parameters contributions
3. This is more intersting to understand the mechanism part which will allow us to understand how each variables contribute to the indian ocean warming
4. Finally it allow us to compare our simulations and we will be able to tell that we can better mach our simulations with cmip simulations , so that we can do sensitivity experiments and understand the contributions
